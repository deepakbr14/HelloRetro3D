To run it from the command line use something like  
```python main.py```

If you get an error like:  
Traceback (most recent call last):  
File "main.py", line 1, in  
from Retro3D import *  
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Retro3D'  

it means you need to install Retro3D

Try this:  
```pip install Retro3D```

or this:  
    * terminal to the directory that has the file **`requirements.txt`**  
    * ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
